        para1="The information you provide will be used by Bal Mitra School to manage your child’s application throughout the admissions process. For details on how your data is collected, stored, and shared, please refer to our Data Protection Policy.

If your child is not offered a place, or if you choose not to accept an offer, we will retain your information only as long as necessary—typically for 12 months following the conclusion of the admissions process, unless exceptional circumstances apply.

We encourage all families considering admission to visit Bal Mitra School during our Open Mornings (usually held in October and March) or to schedule a private appointment during the school day.

Parents should complete the Registration Form and submit it to the Admissions Secretary along with the non-refundable registration fee. Once received, the school will contact you to arrange a convenient day for the prospective pupil to spend a morning at Bal Mitra School."
        para2="Bal Mitra School is not strictly selective on academic criteria. External candidates for Years 1 and 2 will participate in assessments of reading, writing, spelling, and maths. Candidates for Years 3 to 6 will undertake more formal assessments in English and maths.

During registration, parents are asked to share any serious medical conditions or disabilities that the school should be aware of. Where appropriate, the school may request specialist advice or assessments to ensure that any necessary adjustments are planned. We handle all such information sensitively and with respect for confidentiality."
