        para1="From the moment I first walked through the doors of West House as a boy in 1980, I knew this was a special place. My prep school days were filled with warmth, purpose, and countless opportunities that extended far beyond the classroom.

That experience has shaped my vision for what West House should continue to offer its pupils today. Above all, I want to see children arriving each morning with excitement—ready to immerse themselves in school life, embrace new challenges, and celebrate every success along the way.

While academic excellence remains at the core of what we do, it is often the wider curriculum that creates the most lasting memories—whether it’s playing cricket for the 1st XI, winning the inter-house music competition, or performing on stage before a full audience. These are the moments our boys will carry with them long after their time at West House."
        para2="West House is a truly distinctive school. Parents value our open-door policy, appreciating the informality and the ease with which they can approach even the most senior members of staff without the need for appointments. Their wholehearted support of the school, and pride in their sons’ achievements, form a vital part of our community.

As a small independent preparatory school for boys, West House has earned a reputation for achieving far beyond its size. By blending the best of our traditions with a forward-looking approach to innovation, we provide an exceptional education that prepares our boys not only for the next stage of their schooling, but also for life in the 21st century"
