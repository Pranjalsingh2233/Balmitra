        para1="West House is an independent preparatory school for boys aged 4–11, dedicated to nurturing well-rounded individuals through strong values that last a lifetime.

Alongside, West House Nursery welcomes boys and girls from 6 months upwards, providing a warm and supportive first step in their learning journey.

For over 125 years, we’ve been celebrated for our family atmosphere and our ability to strike the perfect balance between academic excellence and a caring, nurturing environment where every child can flourish.

Our pupils not only achieve outstanding academic results but also develop into confident, resilient individuals with excellent communication, creativity, and problem-solving skills."
        para2="While preparing pupils for Birmingham’s leading secondary schools is central to our academic approach, our true focus goes beyond exams. We inspire children to apply themselves with enthusiasm, discover joy in learning, and develop the resilience to overcome challenges. These qualities will empower them to thrive not just today, but well into the middle of the century and beyond.

This is made possible by our dedicated teaching staff, who create an inclusive environment where every child’s potential is nurtured. With small class sizes and a rich, varied programme of extra-curricular activities enjoyed by all, every pupil is given the opportunity to grow, explore, and shine."
